            Vivaah + was not born in a boardroom, but from a simple, personal experience: the realization that the joy of planning a wedding was often overshadowed by the stress of managing vendors, budgets, and endless spreadsheets. Our founders, a team of passionate wedding planners and tech innovators, dreamt of a platform that wouldn't just manage the logistics, but would nurture the excitement and creativity of the couple.

            We started with a single promise: to simplify the complex. Vivaah +, meaning Wedding Plus, is exactly that—a comprehensive solution that adds ease, elegance, and expertise to every step of your journey. We curated a verified network of the nation's best photographers, venues, caterers, and designers, building a community based on trust and quality.
